# User-defined Linked List and Doubly Linked List

## Overview

This repository contains the basics of a User-defined linked list and a doubly linked list in C++. I made them as simple as possible and included implementations. 

### Note

This is a user defined linked list!!! Before proceeding, make sure you are familiar with classes, structures, pointers (including dynamic allocation), static members, constructors and deconstructors, encapsulation, etc.

## Features

- **Linked List**
  - Basic operations: append, delete, and insert.


- **Doubly Linked List**
  - Bidirectional traversal.
  - Enhanced insertion and deletion capabilities.
  - More efficient for certain operations compared to basic linked lists.

## Getting Started

 - Run the code and see what happens!

### Prerequisites

- C++ 13.1.0
- An IDE + Complier (e.g., g++)
